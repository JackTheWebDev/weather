# Leaf 3

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/leaf/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/leaf)

Leaf is a PHP framework that helps you create clean, simple but powerful web apps and APIs quickly and easily. Leaf introduces a cleaner and much simpler structure to the PHP language while maintaining it's flexibility. With a simple structure and a shallow learning curve, it's an excellent way to rapidly build powerful and high performant web apps and APIs.

Leaf 3 brings a much cleaner, faster and simpler workflow to your apps. Powered by an ecosystem of powerful modules with zero setup and it's ease of use, Leaf now allows you to tackle complexities no matter the scale.

## üì¶ Installation

**Install Leaf 3:**

You can create a Leaf 3 app with the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v3 --basic
```

`<project-name>` is your project name

You can also use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Leaf 3 in your project quickly.

```bash
composer require leafs/leaf v3.0-beta
```

**Install Leaf 2:**

Since leaf 3 is still in beta, you might want to install the stable leaf 2 instead. You can do this with Leaf CLI or composer.

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --basic
```

Or with composer

```sh
composer require leafs/leaf
```

## üóÇ Basic Usage

This is a simple demonstration of Leaf's simplicity.
After [installing](#installation) Leaf, create an _index.php_ file.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . "/vendor/autoload.php";

// Base example
app()->get("/", function () {
  response()->json([
    "message" => "Welcome!"
  ]);
});

app()->run();
```

**If you use the Leaf CLI, this is already done for you üöÄ.**

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

**You can view the full documentation [here](https://leafphp.netlify.app/#/)**
